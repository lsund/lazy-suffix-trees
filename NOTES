rho is trialpercentage. Number of trials is (textlen * rho)

export DEBUGLEVEL to enable debugging

some functions like allocandusespaceptr is not implemented

UTF encoding:

ASSUMPTIONS:

1. pattern file and text file are encoded in the same way


OBSERVATIONS:

1. Only characters in the pattern file needs to be considered, due to lazy
   construction

2. The sort is based on the fact that characters are of 1 byte (a normal
   character). By preprocessing the text into long unsigned ints, it will be
   possible to represent all characters. This will however require 8 times as
   much space.
