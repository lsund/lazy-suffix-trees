ASSUMPTIONS:

1. pattern file and text file are encoded in the same way


OBSERVATIONS:

1. Only characters in the pattern file needs to be considered, due to lazy
   construction

2. The sort is based on the fact that characters are of 1 byte (a normal
   character). By preprocessing the text into long unsigned ints, it will be
   possible to represent all characters. This will however require 8 times as
   much space.

CONCLUSIONS:

The only thing that makes this algorithm effective is the fact that it iterates
over characters.

There are a few reasons for this:

* Memory is allocated for the algorithm in one place:
  spaceman:get_sortbuffer. Here, one byte is allocated for each suffix.

* This space is 'chopped' into chunks by the sorting algorithm. Under the
  assumption that the first character only can be a Unsigned char, only an
  array with 258 entries is needed to manage the bounds of these chunks.
