# WOTD

This implements lazy suffix tree construction, inspired by the following:

```
Giegerich, R. and Kurtz, S. and Stoye, J.
Efficient Implementation of Lazy Suffix Trees,
Software-Practice and Experience
33(11):1035-1049, 2003
```

In contrast to the implementations of Kurtz. et. al, this algorithm works for
UTF-8 encoded documents.
