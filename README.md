```
@ARTICLE{GIE:KUR:STO:2003,
author =        "Giegerich, R. and Kurtz, S. and Stoye, J.",
title =         {{Efficient Implementation of Lazy Suffix Trees}},
journal =       {Software---Practice and Experience},
volume =        {{33}},
number =        {{11}},
pages =         {{1035-1049}},

The goal of this reimplementation is to make the algorithm work for unicode.
This is a work in progres.s
